<!--HEY! YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO SEE THIS!-->

<!--Ok, so you might be wondering, What's the point of this page?-->
<!--Well, I'm going to be honest with you, index is kind of a dumb name for a landing page-->
<!--Isn't it so much nicer when you get to be on a page call HOME-->
<!--So instead of finding a work around, I just made this page auto send you to home.html-->
<!--Along with that, if we ever decide to use anubis or some other kind of anti-AI CAPTCHA, having a seprate page for it can be useful-->

<!--Anyway, here's the secret image: images/supersecretpictureoflebron.html-->
